# Basic-Portfolio

For my first homework assignment I followed the design guidelines and made sure that the final product was pixel perfect. I added animated fade transitions to links and buttons for a more pleasing hover effect. For the bonus, I was able to make the footer sticky.

The portfolio items are actual websites that I have built throughout my career as a web designer.

I also decided to make the design responsive so that the design looks good at all browser sizes and different devices. I tested in browsers Safari, Google Chrome, and Firefox. I also tested on my iPhone 6 Plus.

I ran into an issue on the Contact page where the buttons were animating on page load. I did a Google search and found a solution that required to add a little bit of JavaScript to stop animations until everything is loaded.
